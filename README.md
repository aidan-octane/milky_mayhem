A system that will psychologically torture my roommate based off of his milk usage.

My roommate drinks milk. Way too much of it. Oftentimes, a gallon in TWO DAYS. That's just criminal.
He also likes to play tricks on me. He likes to deliver secret messages and little code. I would call it psychological torture - he's thorough enough to where, every time anybody says something weird to me, my first thought is...did my roommate get them to say that to me as part of some code?

So, this device will detect how much milk he drinks (by using IR sensors sticking out of a yogurt container next to the milk), publically shame him on a Twitter account (@waytoomuchmilk), and also use a Raspberry Pi (which is hosting the databases and server connections) to deliver HIM a secret encoded message. Every night, at midnight, a creepy message & song plays out of mysterious speakers in a box next to his room, followed by a number repeated in the SAM voice (the first computer-generated voice simulation - you've heard it). It's scary, and it is going to make him believe that I am delivering him a secret code. This will drive him crazy as he tries to figure out what the code means. Little does he know that each number in the 'code' is just how many glasses of milk he's had that day.
